/**
 * <p>
 * Collect cooccurrences data from texts, according to 
 * Stefan Evert. 2005, 
 * <a href="https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/bitstream/11682/2573/1/Evert2005phd.pdf">The Statistics of Word Cooccurrences, Word Pairs and Collocations.</a> 
 * and Gambette &amp; Véronis 2009 
 * <a href="http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~gambette/2009GambetteVeronis.pdf">Visualising a Text with a Tree Cloud</a>,
 * allowing to draw dendrograms or networks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The raw frequency of words in texts give usually a lot of information about the contents.
 * For example, texts with lots of occurrences of the word "literature" should talk about "theater" and "poetry", 
 * but sometimes, the corpus is more about "scientific literature". The link between words is important.
 * Give a sensible picture of such information need some art, but first, we need to collect information,
 * and not forget what we could need.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a sliding window of words (ex: 30, the span of a reader immediate attention) cross a set of texts of wc words (wc = word count) 
 * by some step (1 word is complete but expensive), it produces N events (= wc/step).
 * A data structure can record co-presence counts of words inside the window at each step.
 * Let say a="parce", and b="que" ("parce que" is a very common French phrase).
 * When "parce" is present in the window, the event could be counted by increment a variable called a1, when it is absent, call it a0; same for "que", b1 and b0.
 * Sometimes, a and b are together present in the window (ab11), 
 * a and b may also not be in the window (ab00), b="que" is very often in the window without a="parce" (ab01), and in very special case, when "parce"
 * is the last word of the window, a may be in the window without b="que" (ab10). 
 * The task could be done for a limited word list, or may be all, recording spare matrix of all couples.
 * We fill that a="parce" is highly connected to b="que", but "que" has 
 * lots of other connections (ex: "Est-ce que ?"). 
 * We would like nice formula to prune very common words with low signification, like "to be", 
 * but keeping them in non predictable cases, for example, the personal pronouns are not equally used and could be highly significant in some
 * contexts, like the second person "you" in a novel, usually in dialogs.
 * Other sciences has already encountered such problems, especially, natural history (biodiversity indices, species proximity by characteristics or genes).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Compiling statistic literature about this topic, Evert presents a lots of possible metric calculation using ab11, ab10, ab01, ab00,
 * but without a critic examination to choose one or another. Gambette &amp; Veronis has evaluated 14 formula, and found that some are 
 * not enough robust (ex: delete one word out 5 does not affect too much sense for a human, it should not affect a calculated picture).
 * People who have played with such visualization know how volatile can be trees, classifications or pictures, with little modifications of parameters.
 * Good metrics should be robust.
 * The Gambette &amp; Veronis results are very instructive, but they do not try an explanation of their observations. 
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Jaccard: a ∩ b / a ∪ b = ab11 / (ab11 + ab10 + ab01) </li>
 *  <li>Mutual information: log(P(a, b)/P(a)P(b)) = (ab11 / N) / (a1/N * b1/N) = log(N * ab11 / a1*b1)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * According to Gambette &amp; Veronis, mutual information is the worst distance measure for their protocol, and Jaccard among the best.
 * The expected value (probability P(x)) is very common in statistics, but does it make sense for texts?
 * Expectation is said of random variables, like a dice, where the values from 1 to 6 define a closed and complete universe.
 * For texts, absence of a word does not make sense, because a corpus is never complete, there is always a universe outside of texts, 
 * with lost opuses and works to be written.
 * A corpus, even a supposed perfect book like Bible or Coran,
 * can always be another (different versions), so lexical statistics should not rely on the total of words N (expected value or negation).
 * A simple example will help. Consider the dictionary like a supermarket with lots of products. We can compare the basket of 2 people (2 texts)
 * and compare the products they have in common, and the ones they do not share.
 * We can’t conclude a lot about what the two have not bought (if they have not bought toys, 
 * does it mean that they have no children? it is not noël? Nothing sure can’t be said with this information). 
 * It is exactly the goal of Jaccard formula a ∩ b / a ∪ b. Jaccard was a Swiss botanist comparing ecosystems, he knew that 
 * we can’t be confident in the absence of a species, all conclusions should rely on presences.
